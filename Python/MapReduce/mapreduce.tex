\objective{Understand the MapReduce parallel programming model and implement an example}

As more and more people around the world began to get online, internet companies began to accumulate vast amounts of data.
For example, a search engine may wish to crawl the internet and learn about its link structure or find out what searches are trending.
For large amounts of data, even straightforward calculation and analysis can be intractable.
In 2004 Google published a white paper about the MapReduce programming model.
MapReduce uses a large cluster of off the shelf computers to store and analyze data.
It allows even inexperienced users to solve certain kinds of problems with thousands of machines.

%What kinds of problems can it solve and what are its limitations?

\section{IPython Parallel}

In this lab we will configure a small cluster on a local area network and use it to run a MapReduce job.
In order to create a cluster on the LAN, we will use the IPython.parallel architecture.
This is architecture is quite powerful and abstract.
However, it also allows us to create a small cluster with little overhead.

\subsection{IPython Parallel Overview}

IPython parallel creates a cluster of at least one Controller and one Engine.
The IPython engine listens for python commands over a network connection.
The engine can also listen for and recieve python objects.
The IPython controller is an interface for working with engines.
The controller will keep track of each engine and allow the user to send instructions to each.
Think of the user as the head of a company.
The controller will be the manager and the engines the workers.

\subsection{Starting the Controller and Engines}

The controller and engines require configuration files to run properly.
We will use a helper program call ipcluster to create the appropriate files.
ipcluster allows for various configurations to be created.
Since we will only be implementing a simple example, we only need to tell the controller where to listen for engines.
Since a local area network is typically trustworthy and we are only creating temporary controllers, we tell the controller to listen on all interfaces:

\begin{lstlisting}
ipcontroller --ip=*
\end{lstlisting}

This will also start the controller process in your terminal window.

This will create two JSON configuration files in {\tt /.ipython/profile_default/security/}.
In order to create a network cluster the first thing we need to do is move {\tt ipcontroller-engine.json} to the same directory on a another computer on the network.
After the file is in the correct location, we may start as many engines as there are processors on the machine.
This is done with the {\tt ipengine} command.
Running {\tt ipengine} will start an engine process in the terminal window.
Upon starting an engine on a remote machine, you will see some messages on the controller terminal stating which machine is now connected to the cluster.

\subsection{Using IPython parallel}

Once we have configured a controller and engines, we can use the IPython interface to execute commands.
A Client object is needed to interfacing with the cluster.
To verify that your controller and engines are configured correctly, create a Client as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
from IPython.parallel import Client
c = Client()
\end{lstlisting}

The Client object has an ids attribute which identifies the id of the engines that are connected to the controller.
Verify the engines are connected as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
c.ids
\end{lstlistng}

Now that we have the engines connected to the controller, we need to make a {\tt DirectView} object of the engines.
This object will send and recieve messages to the engines.
There are other types of {\tt View} objects, but in this section we are only concerned with {\tt DirectView}.
The object is created by choosing engines from the ids in the client.

\begin{lstlisting}
dview = c[:]
\end{lstlisting}

The {\tt DirectView} object as an {\tt apply} method that executes code on the engines and a {\tt get} method that retrieves the results.
The {\tt apply} method accepts a function and its arguments.
For example

\begin{lstlisting}
def multipy(x,y):
	return x*y

res = dview.apply(multiply, 2, 3)
\end{lstlisting}

This code runs the {\tt multiply} method with {\tt 2} and {\tt 3} as arguments and returns the output as a {\tt AsyncResult} object.
We use the {\tt get} method to retrieve the output from {\tt res} and store it in a list we'll call {\tt result}

\begin{lstlisting}
result = res.get()
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, it is important to realize that even though Local Area Networks usually have fast connections, communication can easily turn into a bottleneck for your problem.
Try to minimize communication between nodes.

\begin{problem}
You can define a function in IPython and use the Client to apply it to engines available to the controller.
This allows you to write code to be run on any number of machines in one place.
Write a function that will multiply two random 1000x1000 matrices and return the trace of the product.
Note that creating the random on the client and sending them across the network is intractable.
You may want to use the {\tt ready} method with your {\tt AsyncResult} object to see the status of your engines.
If you have a way of monitoring cpu usage on your engines, observe it as the code runs.  You should see a spike when the calculation begins.
\end{problem}

\section{MapReduce}

The MapReduce paradigm on a network cluster consists of two parts.
The ``Map'' step breaks the problem into several parts and gives a part to each worker. 
The ``Reduce'' step waits for the results from each mapper and consolidates them.
It is sometimes useful to have each mapper further divide the problem into smaller parts and reduce their results, creating a tree structure.

\subsection{The Mapper}

The mapper step prepares the inputs to the worker and has the worker solve their subproblems.
For example, we may wish to analyze a large file.
In the mapper step we would split the file into a piece for each worker and then have each worker analyze their part.
Python has a built in {\tt map} function that we will use in our exercises.
This function accepts a function and a sequence of inputs as arguments.
It returns a list of the function applied to each element of the sequence.

For example, we may add 1 to a list of numbers

\begin{lstlisting}
my_map = lambda x: x+1
map(my_map, range(10))
\end{lstlisting} 

In this case, map returns the list of numbers with 1 added to each element.

\subsection{The Reducer}

The reducer step consolidates the result of the individual workers in the mapper step.
For example, suppose we wish to count the number of links to a group of wikipedia articles from within wikipedia.
The mapper step would break wikipedia into sections and assign the workers to count the links in their section to each article.
The reducer step would then take the results and consolidate each count to each article.
Python has a built in {\tt reduce} function that we will use.
This function accepts a function with two arguments and sequence of values.
It returns the function applied to the sequence cumulatively.

For example, we will multipy all the numbers from our previous example.
\begin{lstlisting}
my_reduce = lambda x,y: x*y
reduce(my_reduce, map(my_map, range(10)))
\end{lstlisting}

This case will return the product of the numbers in {\tt range(10)} after adding 1 to them.

\begin{problem}
Write a function that will return the NxN matrix that is the sum of the outer product of vectors of length N with themselves.
This function must use the python {\tt map} and {\tt reduce} functions.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
We will implement mapreduce on our network cluster to count the words in a corpus of documents.
Download the text data from the ACME website.
Choose one engine on the cluster as a reducer, and let the rest of the engines be mappers.
Write a function that allocates text files to mappers until all text files have been processed.
Once the mappers are finished, the reducer should consolidate their results to get a final word count for the whole corpus.
Each mapper should return the word counts of the text files given them.
The reducer should reduce the results of the mappers.
Use the python {\tt map} and {\tt reduce} functions for your mapper and reducer step.
